The following dependencies are required to run the file:
- cv2
- numpy
- PIL

## Dependency Installtion

Open Terminal or Command Prompt and run the following code.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install Pillow
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
The algorithm is contained within 3sk3_project1.py. There are already two images included in the submission. The script will automatically resize img_test_lr.png and save the result in the directory which the script is contained. Both the input and output images will be displayed to screen when interpolation is finished. To run the code use the following line:

```
python 3sk3_project1.py
```

The function will take some time to finish but progress will be outputted to the screen and the code executes.
